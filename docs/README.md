# Screenshots

Add your screenshots here and keep the names used in the top-level README:

- `screenshot-main.png`: main table view
- `screenshot-i2c.png`: I2C scan in progress or results
- `screenshot-dht22.png`: details pane showing a DHT22 reading

Tips:
- If running on Raspberry Pi with GUI: install `scrot` and capture (see root README).
- If running headless: open the TUI from an SSH client with a large terminal and take a desktop screenshot on your computer.
